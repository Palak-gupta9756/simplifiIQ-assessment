Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI, focusing on algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Deep Learning (DL), a specialized subset of ML, utilizes multi-layered neural networks to process complex patterns from vast amounts of data."

However, Python has several data types like lists and tuples (especially lists) that are often used as arrays but, items stored in these types of sequences need not be of the same type.","Unlike languages such as C++ or Java, Python does not have built-in support for arrays. Instead, it utilizes data types like lists and tuples, with lists being commonly used for array-like functionality. A key difference is that items stored in these Python sequences are not restricted to being of the same data type."

Additionally, nested loops involve placing one loop inside another, allowing for more complex repetitive tasks and data processing patterns."
