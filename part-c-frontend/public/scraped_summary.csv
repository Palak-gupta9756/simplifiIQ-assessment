https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_arrays.htm,Python - Arrays,"Unlike other programming languages like C++ or Java, Python does not have built-in support for arrays. However, Python has several data types like lists and tuples (especially lists) that are often used as arrays but, items stored in these types of sequences need not be of the same type.","Unlike languages like C++ or Java, Python does not feature built-in support for arrays. Instead, it leverages data types such as lists and tuples, especially lists, to function as array-like structures. A key distinction of these Python sequences is that their items are not required to be of the same data type."

The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), performing an action for each item. In contrast, the `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition remains true. Nested loops, where one loop is placed inside another, enable more complex iterations, often used for processing multi-dimensional data structures."
